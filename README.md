    # A* Midterm Project
    This is a complete project that implements A* search on a 2D grid (map navigation use-case).
    It includes a small demo script that saves a PNG showing the path found by A*.

    ## What the assignment asks for 
    - Pick a use-case (I picked map navigation / grid pathfinding).
    - Implement an A* search program (this project contains `astar.py`).
    - Share a GitHub link to my code and record a demo explaining my work.

    ## Goal 
    - Imagine a map made of squares. Some squares are blocked (like walls). I want a robot to walk from my home (start) to the candy shop (goal) the fastest way.
    - A* is a smart way to choose which squares to check so the robot doesn't wander around—it's like following a trail that looks promising.

    ## What we provide here
    - `astar.py` — the algorithm implementation.
    - `demo_run.py` — runs a sample grid and saves `demo_output.png` showing the path.
    - `requirements.txt` — Python packages used.
