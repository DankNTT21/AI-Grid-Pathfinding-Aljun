    # A* Midterm Project (sample submission)
    This is a complete sample project that implements A* search on a 2D grid (map navigation use-case).
    It includes a small demo script that saves a PNG showing the path found by A*.

    ## What the assignment asks for (short)
    - Pick a use-case (we pick map navigation / grid pathfinding here).
    - Implement an A* search program (this project contains `astar.py`).
    - Share a GitHub link to your code and record a demo explaining your work (we explain how to do that below).

    ## Goal (explain like you're 5)
    - Imagine a map made of squares. Some squares are blocked (like walls). You want a robot to walk from your home (start) to the candy shop (goal) the fastest way.
    - A* is a smart way to choose which squares to check so the robot doesn't wander around—it's like following a trail that looks promising.

    ## What we provide here
    - `astar.py` — the algorithm implementation (well-commented).
    - `demo_run.py` — runs a sample grid and saves `demo_output.png` showing the path.
    - `requirements.txt` — Python packages used.
    - This README with full step-by-step instructions for setup, running, creating a GitHub repo, recording a demo, and submitting.

    ## What to install (Windows step-by-step – simple clicks)
    1. **Python**: visit `python.org` -> "Downloads" -> click "Download Python 3.x.x". Run the installer, check **Add Python to PATH**, then click **Install Now**.
    2. **Visual Studio Code (optional, recommended)**: visit `code.visualstudio.com` and click the big **Download** button for your OS. Run the installer and accept defaults.
    3. **Git** (to push to GitHub): visit `git-scm.com` and download for Windows/macOS/Linux. Install using default options.
    4. **(Optional GUI for Git)**: you can use **GitHub Desktop** (desktop.github.com) if you prefer clicks over commands.

    ## How to run the demo locally (terminal / command-line)
    1. Open a terminal (Windows: PowerShell or cmd; macOS: Terminal).
    2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the project:
       ```
       cd path\\to\\astar_midterm_project
       ```
    3. (Optional) create a Python virtual environment:
       ```
       python -m venv venv
       .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate   # Windows
       source venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
       ```
    4. Install requirements:
       ```
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
    5. Run the demo script:
       ```
       python demo_run.py
       ```
       This will create `demo_output.png` in the same folder showing the path found by A*.

    ## How to make a GitHub repo and upload (very explicit clicks + commands)
    ### Web (clicks):
    1. Go to `github.com` and sign in (or sign up).
    2. Click the **+** icon in the top-right, choose **New repository**.
    3. Type a repository name (for example `ai-astar-midterm`), add a description (optional), choose **Public**, then click **Create repository**.
    4. You'll see instructions like `git remote add origin ...` — copy the provided URL.

    ### Command-line push (after you created the repo on GitHub):
    1. In the project folder run:
       ```bash
       git init
       git add .
       git commit -m "Initial commit: A* search project"
       git branch -M main
       git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
       git push -u origin main
       ```
       Replace `USERNAME` and `REPO` with your GitHub username and repository name.

    ### Or: Using VSCode (clicks)
    1. Open the project folder in VSCode (File → Open Folder... → select folder).
    2. On the left, click the Source Control icon (looks like a branch).
    3. Click **Initialize Repository**, type a commit message, click the checkmark to commit.
    4. Click the "Publish to GitHub" button that appears at the top of Source Control and follow prompts to create a remote repo and push.

    ## How to record the demo video (very simple)
    - **Windows (quick)**: Press `Win + G` to open Game Bar. Click the round **Record** button or press `Win + Alt + R` to start/stop recording. Run the demo script in terminal while recording.
    - **OBS (recommended, more control)**: download OBS, add a Display Capture source, press **Start Recording**, run demo, then **Stop Recording**.
    - Save the MP4 and upload it somewhere (YouTube as *unlisted*, Google Drive, or attach to your LMS if allowed).

    ## What to include in the recorded demo (2–4 minutes recommended)
    1. Short intro: your name, course, assignment title.
    2. Show the code (open `astar.py`) and briefly explain core parts: heuristic, neighbors, open/closed sets, path reconstruction.
    3. Run `python demo_run.py` so the program prints the path length and shows the resulting image (open `demo_output.png`).
    4. Explain any choices you made (Manhattan vs Euclidean, diagonal movement allowed, complexity tradeoffs).
    5. End with where your GitHub repo and demo video are located (show URLs in the video or paste links in LMS).

    ## What to submit in your LMS (suggested)
    - GitHub repository link (code + README).
    - Link to recorded demo (YouTube unlisted / Google Drive).
    - A short description inside the LMS explaining what you implemented and where to find the files in your repo.

    ## Notes / Next steps
    - This project is a full, working starting point. You can extend it: add interactive GUI (Pygame), make the grid random, load maps from images, or implement the 8-puzzle variant.
    - If you want, I can generate a ZIP with these files (code + README + demo image) so you can upload directly — see the downloadable archive I created for you in the chat below.
